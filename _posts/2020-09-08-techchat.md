I was a [guest of Ken Rimple's on TechChat][techchat-video] today. It's a series where he covers current events in technology with members of the broader technology community.

We talked about some great stuff - my favorite topic was [The Missing Semester of your CS Education][missing-cs], which I'm still thinking about. There's 9 other episodes in the [TechCast Archive][techchat-archive] already, with more to follow I'm sure.
