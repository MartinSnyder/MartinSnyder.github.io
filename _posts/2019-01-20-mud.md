title: HaskellMUD
---

Conversations about my experience with Elm led me to Haskell, and I'd always wanted to write an application that depended on data mutation in a purely functional language. Over the recent holiday, I decided to make a MUD, in part because the first large code base I worked on was a DikuMUD that ran in the early 90's.

This is more complicated than "Snake" obviously, both in terms of software complexity and creative complexity. The world I created only has 3 rooms so far, and I left out some important features like items and combat. Let's all agree to just refer to the missing elements as "exercises left for the reader."

Here is my ["Multi User Domain" named HaskellMUD][mud-impl].
