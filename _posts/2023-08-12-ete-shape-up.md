title: Philly ETE - Shaping up your development process
---

Pinnacle 21 adopted Shape Up in early 2021, so we've been using it just about as long as anyone who didn't invent it! I talked about the methodology and our experience with it at
[Philly ETE][ete-2023] in April of 2023. The [session video][video-shape-up] is now online and viewable by the public.
