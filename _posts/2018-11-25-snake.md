Elm had been on my list to check out for quite some time. I finally got the chance to play with it and wrote a game to play with the kids.

I chose to write a simple implementation of the classic Snake game. I later found out that pretty much everyone does this and it may be the least original idea I ever had.

Check out [my implementation of the classic game "Snake"][snake-impl].
