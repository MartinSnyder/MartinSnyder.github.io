I was moving my documents collection to "The Cloud" and I came across a [Player's Guide for Ultima V][ultima5-guide] I had written back when I was in college and a [NetHack Battle Report][nethack-br] I wrote to introduce people to the game shortly after. Writing those by themselves were nostaligic events, as they were two of my favorites growing up.

So now, Ultima V and NetHack bring a smile to my face for a third time. I celebrated the find by converting them both to markdown to share here. I checked, and the best way to play Ultima V today is to buy the [Ultima IV-V-VI Bundle from GOG][ultima-bundle]. If that's too pricey for you, [Ultima IV is available for free][ultima4-free]! [Nethack, of course, has always been free][nethack-site].
