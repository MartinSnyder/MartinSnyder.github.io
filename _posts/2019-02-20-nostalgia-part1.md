I was moving my documents collection to "The Cloud" and I came across a [Player's Guide for Ultima V][ultima5-guide] I had written back when I was in college. That itself was a nostalgic event, because the game was one of my favorites from growing up.

So now, Ultima V brings a smile to my face for a third time. I celebrated the find by converting the guide to markdown to share here. I checked, and the best way to play Ultima V today is to buy the [Ultima IV-V-VI Bundle from GOG][ultima-bundle]. If that's too pricey for you, [Ultima IV is available for free][ultima4-free]!
