						<h3>A Story in Five Parts</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Part 1 - The Book</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/one-true-book.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
							Don't worry everybody, I've found the answer!
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Part 2 - Off to a Great Start</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/reckless-changes.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
							What was slowing us down was all that process. Now we can move faster.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Part 3 - Down to Business</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/sweat-shop.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
							Now that we've gotten the low-hanging fruit, we can build a big ticket pipeline.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Part 4 - No Leaders</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/no-leaders.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
							Hey - this is probably what we should do next, right? Maybe we're here because the real leader(s) moved on?
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Part 5 - Accountability</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/conflict-over-collaboration.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
							When it's time to take responsibility, it's time for finger-pointing.
						</aside>
					</section>
	
					<section>
						<h3>Epilog - Common Agile Failures</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Focus on 100% resource utilization</li>
							<li>Lack of ownership</li>
							<li>Ineffective or absent collaboration</li>
							<li>Us vs. them mentality, unidirectional relationships</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>High utilization neutralizes expertise</li>
								<li>Decision makers won't take responsibility for decisions</li>
								<li>The people doign the work degrade to just "doing what they are told"</li>
								<li>Lack of ownership especially with respect to technical debt</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>Remedial Agile</h3>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Properties of Agile Teams</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Self-organizing</li>
							<li>Cross-functional</li>
							<li>Highly engaged</li>
							<li>Empowered</li>
							<li>Constantly collecting feedback</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Bad - blocked on external resources</li>
								<li>Bad - overridden at the end</li>
								<li>Bad - implementing same agile everywhere</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Priorities of Agile Teams</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Build the right thing</li>
							<li>Always maintain your release capability</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>The further you drift from a releasable product, the less agile you are.</li>
								<li>If you want to go faster, increase quality before effort</li>

						<h3>Introducing Shape Up</h3>
						Shape up is a macro-level agile methodology focused on the product / engineering collaboration
						<img src="shape-up/a-better-idea.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Pitch</h3>
						A written proposal expressing a problem area, solution parameters, justification, and boundaries
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Problem/justification are key aspects of the pitch</li>
								<li>Want to mention rabbit holes and no-gos as well.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>NOTE: Anyone can write a pitch!</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/anyone-can-write.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
							Man, I hope everyone has seen Ratatoille
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Appetite</h3>
						Budget, in the sense of how much "product" is willing to spend on a specific pitch.
						<ul>
							<li>Typically expressed as either a "Small Batch" of 2 weeks or a "Big Batch" of 6 weeks.</li>
							<li>Items that exceed their appetite are returned to the betting table for re-assessment.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>People seem bad at working with a real budget, so a fake one can work better</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Betting</h3>
						Ritual where the product team discusses the available pitches and chooses which ones to invest in.						
						<aside class="notes">
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Negotiation</h3>
						Discussion between product, engineering, design, and test, to determine a preferred implementation within the appetite.
						<aside class="notes">
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Cycle</h3>
						The execution phase of Shape Up. Divided into a planned, development phase (termed "Batch") and a unplanned phase (termed "Cooldown")

						<h3>Certara Shape Up Implementation</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Disclaimers</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>No silver bullets - all changes require effort</li>
							<li>Process improvement won't address a people problem</li>
							<li>Certara delivers enterprise software products to a regulated market</li>
							<li>Your Mileage May Vary</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							We talked to Ryan Singer about our implementation and he indicated that one of the most "scaled-up" shape up implementations in the B2B space
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Collaboration Model - Key Roles</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Product Analyst</li>
							<li>Product Designer</li>
							<li>Software Engineer</li>
							<li>Software Tester</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Staffing Ratios</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>6:1 Engineer to product ratio</li>
							<li>4:1 Engineer to test ratio </li>
							<li>15:1 Engineer to design ratio</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Cycle Timelines</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Betting meeting is held at start of cooldown</li>
							<li>When on schedule, 25% of total engineering time is unplanned</li>
							<li>Carry-over is deadly</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="shape-up/cycle-timeline.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Items that exceed their appetite will eventually cause other items to get cancelled as a result</li>
								<li>Don't let this happen - kill quicky so that the responsible part is affected, not the innocent</li>
								<li>Incentives are aligned. Engineering needs to finish on time to "earn" the elective activities</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Release Timelines</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>We introduced "Release Finalization" to manage our infrequent release schedule</li>
							<li>Includes merge, refinement, and end-to-end testing</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="shape-up/release-timeline.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>In our market, customers don't want new versions as often as others. As a result, we ship about every six months.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Betting Responsibilities - Product</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Present pitches the author is willing to fight for</li>
							<li>Balance intuition with data and research</li>
							<li>Focus on problem articulation</li>
							<li>Prepare for negotiation without negotiating</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Sometimes a single pitch can take 100+ hours spread over multiple months to develop</li>
								<li>Other times a single research effort can result in multiple pitches</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Betting Responsibilities - Engineering</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Understand all pitches and highlight risks and issues</li>
							<li>Clarify actual engineering capacity available</li>
							<li>Articulate and enforce constraints</li>
							<li>"Technical Initiatives" that cannot fit into cooldown activities are represented as pitches</li> 
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>We don't use shape up for everything, especially "reactive efforts" like support</li>
								<li>people onboarding or with other responsibilities might have partial availability</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Desired Betting Outcomes</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Available engineering capacity is consumed</li>
							<li>50-75% of authored pitches are selected</li>
							<li>Authors whose pitches were not selected are angry</li>
							<li>Selected pitches reasonably reflect portfolio priorities</li>
							<li>Engineering organization is able to produce an execution plan</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Pitches that are not selected do not die</li>
								<li>Want to be able to replace low priority work on one product with higher priority work on another</li>
								<li>"Mobility" is key to being able to support that flexibility</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Execution Additions</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Similar efforts will be grouped together for better coordination</li>
							<li>"Second opinions" available during negotiation</li>
							<li>Scorecard completed at the end</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Coordination helps testing, product, and engineering leadership to have fewer conversations</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h3>Create New Specification (Before)</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/p21-define-before.jpg" />
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Items displayed in order of implementation mostly</li>
								<li>Initial users understood the options and chose appropriately</li>
								<li>As customer base grew, analytics showed the worst options were being selected</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Create New Specification (After)</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/p21-define-after.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Heavy on design for this one, light on engineering</li>
								<li>First use in our application of a triptych</li>
								<li>Have expanded the design concept into other areas now</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>In Application Quizzes</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/p21-quiz.png" />

								<li>Added categories and other niceties like confetti</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Spec Chat</h3>
						<img src="shape-up/p21-chat.png" style="width: 50%" />
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Analytics showed that users were exporting far more than expected</li>
								<li>Q&A showed that they were collaborating with users not in the system</li>
								<li>So many potential ways to solve this - negotiation is key</li>
								<li>So is no-go/rabbit whole of generalizing too soon</li>
