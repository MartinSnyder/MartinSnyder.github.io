                        Does going to school pay off?  Most people think so.  Currently almost 90 percent of young adults graduate from high school and about 60 percent of high school seniors continue on to college the following year.  People decide to go to college for many reasons.  One of the most compelling is the expectation of future economic success based on educational attainment.
