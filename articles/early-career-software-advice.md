title: Breaking into Software Engineering
---

Getting first job as a software engineer has always been an anxiety-laden exercise, but 2024 is shaping up to be rougher than most other years, and rougher for a much larger number of people. For instance, there are still 2023 CS graduates out there looking for their first opportunities, a month before the market will be flooded with 2024 graduates. Add to that the significant number of career changers either self-taught, leaning in non-software roles, or retraining through boot camps and similar institutions. I'm writing this to share some guidance for everyone in that category, whether you're approaching graduation without a job, or you graduated a while ago and are still looking.

The first point to make is that rising software engineering salaries works against people looking for their first job. It sounds great when you read about it online, but hiring managers are under a lot of pressure to extract some actual value in return for that salary and the bar of entry rises each time the salary does.

The second point to make is that most first-time job seekers struggle to make it through screening to the interview stage, then struggle in the technical assessments in the few interview opportunities they get. This is very discouraging, of course, and fills candidates with self doubt. In the end, it doesn't matter if there are problems with the educational apparatus that delivered them to the job market or whether any part of the process is fair or unfair. All that matters is where you go from here, for people that fall into this category.

One great example of people lamenting some aspect of unfairness is the standard grip online "How will I ever get the required experience if no one will give me a chance?" I wrote about this in my [Musings on College][college] which I think might bring some insight to people in this situation whether you are still in college, already graduated, or didn't go at all. The summary on the experience point is that if you are being rejected for this reason, it's likely some combination of "you haven't done enough things" and "you haven't formed enough opinions."

It's not worth solving the problem of "getting screened out too much" if you are just going to fail the technical interview anyway, so we have to solve the technical interview first. Odds are that you have to learn more than you know now. This is the case because no matter how well prepared you think you are or actually are for the field of software engineering, 6 months in you will know siginficantly more.
