title: Forward for Before It's Too Late
---

My father was a scientist and researcher at heart. At the time of his death in early 2024, he had been working to finish this very book, about climate change and energy policy. He had grown to believe (as many others have) that climate change was an existential threat to humanity and that our mechanisms for creating energy in its various forms are directly responsible. Further though, he believed that the greatest challenges to the advancement of humankind in these areas were political in nature, rather than scientific or engineering. In his own words, "the only way to make real progress was through political action, resulting from an educated population." This book was his individual effort to drive towards that action through education.

By first carefully walking the reader through the history of the planet as it relates to the development and evolution of Earthâ€™s climate, Marty is able to explain both what we know (through scientific consensus) and also how we know what we know - what evidence supports these conclusions. It is thoroughly researched, in that my father's personal collections contain many binders filled with clipped or printed articles and excerpts for every fact and claim listed in this book. In many cases, single sections or even paragraphs can explode into entire books on just that one topic.

He was so passionate about learning through all of his years, and was excited to share that passion with others. He would have wanted every reader to consider this only the start of their journey into these topics, and to pick and choose from there which parts of this story they wanted to learn more about. Richard Feynman once reflected that "science is a culture of doubt" and my father would not have asked anyone to trust him or any other single source. Rather he would have wanted readers to ask additional questions beyond what he asked and researched, then hunt down the answers as he did. This book is his gift to the curious, to prepare them for that journey and allow them to pick up where he left off.

This is my father's greatest unfinished work, one he spent the last decade of his life working to complete. It was a great honor to complete the final editing and publish this to share it with the world.
