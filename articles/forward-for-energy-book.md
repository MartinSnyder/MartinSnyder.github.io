title: Forward for Energy Book
---

My father was a scientist and researcher at heart. At the time of his death in early 2024, he had been working to finish this book, about climate change and energy policy. He had grown to believe (as many others have) that climate change was an existential threat to humanity and that our mechanisms for creating energy in its various forms are directly responsible.

Further though, he believed that the greatest challenges to the advancement of humankind in these areas were political in nature, not scientific or engineering. When speaking to me about this book, he remarked that "the only way to make real progress was through political action, resulting from an educated population." This book was his individual effort to drive towards that action through education.

Early in the book he writes "This is largely a book of history, not mystery, so the plot can be revealed at the outset." Taking this same liberty, I feel it is helpful to summarize this work in order to help readers better navigate it.

One of the key points made throughout is that all forms of power generation (save for nuclear fission) are directly related to the sun. In some cases, like solar panels, the sun's energy is directly converted to electricity. In others, like the fossil fuels, physical items act effectively as batteries by converting the sun's energy into biomass while living. Nuclear fusion, of course, is just a local instance of the sun's primary energy-generating reaction. This was compelling to me, when I was the reader, because if everything boils down to the same core reaction, then the rest of the conversation generally boils down to convenience and efficiency.

While many of the points made in this book about the various forms of power generation will be familiar to the reader, there is one that I felt is discussed clearly here and not included in other assessments. "Density" is a measure of how much space is consumed to produce an equivalent power output. The modern "green" solutions of wind, solar and hydro-electric all score very poorly by this measure, as explained in this text. This is a significant factor in my father's conclusion that nuclear solutions are the best long-term answers.

This book carefully walks the reader through the history of the planet as it relates to the climate and energy policy, and works to explain not only what we know (through scientific consensus) but how we know what we know - what evidence supports these conclusions. It is very well researched, in that my father's personal collections contains many binders filled with clipped or printed out articles and excerpts for every fact and claim listed in this book. These are not all cited due to volume. In many cases, single sections or even paragraphs can explode into entire books on just that one topic.

Consider this work a survey of all that is out there, and the start of your journey. The breadcrumbs are all here to satisfy your curiosity, but additional reading will be required to delve into the depths of any single topic. Recall that Richard Feynman once reflect that "science is a culture of doubt" and know that my father would not ask that you trust him or any other single source. Rather he would be satisfied that you understood the points made in this book, and sought out additional information on your own to further your education and shore up your knowledge.

His hope was that anyone and everyone could enjoy this book, regardless of their educational level. To accomplish this, he made great effort as an author to explain complicated matters in simple terms. He also provides more advanced information throughout the text in over 200 footnotes. His intention was for the reader to consume information to their own tolerance, and to feel free to skip around and focus on topics of personal interest if desired, rather than to force everyone to read the full text front to back.

This is my father's greatest unfinished work, one he spend the last decade of his life working to complete. It was my pleasure to complete the final editing and publish this to share it with the world.
