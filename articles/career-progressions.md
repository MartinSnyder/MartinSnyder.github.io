title: Career Progressions
---

For many people starting their careers, it's hard to understand what people "more senior" to them do, especially in office environments. Eventually, they will begin to out-perform more senior people (from their own perspective) . It's a challenge to reconcile pay scales with logic when it appears that they are just as, or more effective than the rest of the team. Sometimes they are right, in that some other team members may be dead weight. Other times though, they just don't have visibility into what work the more senior people are doing. In many career progressions, this is the case, where the work of the more senior people is invisible to the lower levels. Simply put, higher-level jobs can be wholly different from lower-level jobs. It is not simply a matter of more/better/faster.

There are many axes in a career ladder, but some are common across fields and professional disciplines. Some of the axes with the broadest applicability are:
* Scope of responsibility
* Autonomy
* Organizational Impact

Let's consider 4 basic levels that we can explore across these axes:
1. Associate / Entry Level
2. Established / Medium Level
3. Professional / Senior Level
4. Lead / Post-Senior Level

Now we can build a grid to show what is generally expected of people as they progress. This is designed to span industries and professional disciplines. As a result, some of the details may not match up in all cases. The general idea holds for most "professional" disciplines at least, and is translatable in areas where it doesn't match up well.

|                | Entry                                                              | Medium                                                                             | Senior                                                                          | Post-Senior                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope/Quality  | Single item of limited scope completable in hours or 1-2 days      | Multiple items contributing to a higher-level deliverable completable in 1-4 weeks | Sequence of high-level deliverables in a related area completable in 1-6 months | Final responsibility for client deliverables        |
| Autonomy       | Requires significant oversight                                     | Requires minimal oversight                                                         | Requires no oversight<br>Provides oversight to others                           | Determines what works needs to be done              |
| Organizational | Strives to understand organizational policies and comply over time | Follows organizational policies without friction                                   | Leads organization and drives desired changes                                   | Builds and shapes the organization and its policies |

Knowing this, we can derive some "promotable behaviors" that are very helpful for people to have in mind as they go about their day-to-day duties. Some of these are more obvious than others!

|                | Entry                                                              | Medium                                                                             | Senior                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope/Quality  | Do great work quickly, and explore unassigned work as time permits | Volunteer to take on work that other people avoid or fear                          | Learn and become a backup for all of the secret steps in the delivery pipeline  |
| Autonomy       | Produce work that requires little or no revision                   | Contribute as much as possible through the peer review processes                   | Mentor more junior members of the team to accelerate their growth               |
| Organizational | Keep your head down and do what you are told                       | Volunteer for policy review and try to get involved in the recruiting processes    | Research other, similar organizations and make recommendations for improvement  |
