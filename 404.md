Sorry, I probably screwed this up by publishing a link and then changing it. Based on popularity, you are probably looking for one of these
* [Attention to Detail][atd]
* My implementation of [Classic Snake][snake]
* [HaskellMUD][mud]
* [Ultima V Player's Guide][ultima5]

Everything I published should be listed on the [Home Page][home] or in one of the top sections: [Presentations][presentations], [Publications][publications], or [Projects][projects].

Thanks for visiting, I hope you find what you were looking for!
